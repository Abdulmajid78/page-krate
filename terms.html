                        was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings
                        of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,
                        dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled
                        and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                        foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
                        in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through.
